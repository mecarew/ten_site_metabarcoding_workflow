This notebook is designed to filling missing taxonomic assignments from the vsearch step (in 03_classification) in the metabarcoding workflow and make corrections to taxonomic assignments that are incorrectly assigned by vsearch due to errors in the DNA barcode reference libraries (SECTION 1).It also performs a final flitering to detect and remove species detections that have most likely arisen from 'mistagging' (SECTION 2). It has been modified to produce a final dataset for the 10 site study.

# reading in data
The MiSeq13 runs contains the bulk of the data for the 10 site study. However, a few samples require re-running therefore the data need to be retrieved and combined into a final dataset prior to filtering.

Samples requiring re-running
40BNY29042 <- re-run in MiSeq15 (3 replicates 40BNY29042rep3, 40BNY29042rep4 and 40BNY29042rep5 (only need 2 reps))

10FEH41841 <- re-run in MiSeq15 (3 replicates labelled 10FEH41841rep3, 10FEH41841rep4 and 10FEH41841rep5 (only need 2 reps))

30DNG75620 <- re-run in MiSeq16 (3 replicates labelled Elut30DNG79574rep1, Elut1030DNG79574rep2 and Elut30DNG75620rep3 (only need 2 reps))

## SECTION 1: Filling in missing/incorrect taxonomic classifications

A file based on analysis of Miseq datasets was constructed ('asv_library_97_aug24.xlsx'). This file captures ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) from the DADA2 step (where the metabarcoding data is reduced into a series of sequence groups with high sequence similarity i.e. ASVs) and this file:
-   fills truncated taxonomy assignments from the vsearch step (sheet 1)
-   groups unclassified sequences into 'OTUs' (sheet 2)
-   updates/corrects any missing identifications or errors in classification (sheet 3)
-   identifies any ambiguous taxonomic assignments that should be considered as complexes (sheet 4)

```{r}

# Step 2: Join to final_df and update taxonomy fields ONLY

## SECTION 2: PCR filtering
This section is designed to format data and filter it for 'mistagging'. Mistagging or 'tag switching' can occur causing ASVs to be assigned to the wrong sample. This occurs at a low frequency and is usually random. PCR replicates included in the study design help detect and remove these errors. We use three PCR replicates and filter out any species/ASV detections that occur in only one PCR replicate (which are most likely from mistagging). We also add a second flitering step for the five most common ASV (those with the highest number of reads/sequences). These are more likely to be involved in mistagging and can appear in multiple PCR replicate we add a reads threshold for removing these detections.

# Change data to long formmat (list) for PCR replicate filtering 
Note: This code will need to be configured for each dataset, so that the rows containing the read counts are specified (e.g. pivot_longer(cols = X10BNY29042rep1:Cont3rep1), the 'X10BNY29042rep1:Cont3rep1' will need to be changed to the first and last column name with the reads data for each dataset
Miseq13:X10BNY29042rep1:Cont3rep1 
```{r}
# Step 1: Add 'X' prefix to column names if they start with a number
final_df_filled <- final_df_filled %>%

  filter(value != 0) %>%  # Remove rows where value is zero
  select(-matches("^X(\\.\\d+)?$"))  # Remove unwanted columns named X, X.1, etc.

# Step 3: Create a 'replicate' column by extracting last character if it ends in 'rep' followed by a number
metab_long <- metab_long %>%
  mutate(replicate = ifelse(grepl("rep[123456]$", sample), str_extract(sample, "rep[123456]$"), ""))

# Step 4: Extract the 'site_per' and 'per' columns based on 'sample'
metab_long <- metab_long %>%
  mutate(site_per = sub("(rep[123456])$", "", sample),  # Remove replicate suffix from sample to get site_per
         per = substr(site_per, 2, 3))  # Take the first two characters of site_per for 'per' column

metab_long <- metab_long %>%
  mutate(
    sample = str_remove(sample, "^X"),
    site_per = str_remove(site_per, "^X")

# Step 5: Create a 'site' column by further trimming 'site_per'
metab_long <- metab_long %>%
  mutate(site = sub("^\\d{2}", "", site_per))  # Remove initial numeric prefix from site_per for site
